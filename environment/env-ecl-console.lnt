    env-ecl-console.lnt:  environment file for Eclipse IDE console output

	This file explains how to set Lint as an external tool for use in
    the Eclipse IDE.  Gimpel Software currently does not have a plug-in
    to offer for the Eclipse IDE.  However, since many of our users have
    requested an env-*.lnt file for the Eclipse IDE, Gimpel Software
    offers this file as a temporary 'stop-gap' measure.

    To establish Lint as an external tool for Linting a single module:
        1.  Click 'Run' from the main toolbar.
        2.  Select 'External Tools'|'External Tools...'.
        3.  Click 'Program' from the list box on the left hand side.
        4.  Click 'New'.
        5.  Enter 'Lint the Current File' in the 'Name' window.
        6.  Under 'Location:', click 'Browse Workspace' and select
            your Lint binary.
        7.  Under 'Working Directory:', click 'Browse Workspace' and
            select the directory of the project in which you work.
        8.  Enter 'std.lnt -u ${resource_name}' in the 'Arguments'
            window.
        9.  Click 'Apply'.

    To run Lint, you can then choose 'Lint the Current File' from the
    'Run'|'External Tools' menu and Lint will Lint your currently
    select source file.

    To establish Lint as an external tool for Linting a project file:
        1.  Follow steps 1-7 above (with 'Lint Project' in the 'Name'
            window).
        2.  Enter 'std.lnt' in the 'Arguments' window followed by
            just '${resource_name}' (omitting the -u option).
        3.  Click 'Apply'.

    To Lint your project, make your project *.lnt file (one containing
    a list of your source files) the current file and select 'Run'|
    'External Tools'|'Lint Project'.
